\section{EXPERIENCE}
{\sl Core0} \textbf{(Software Engineer)} \hfill September 2020 - September 2022 \\
\phantom{Core0} \textbf{(Senior Software Engineer)} \hfill September 2022 - present

Working mainly with Clojure services, hosted on remote datacenters, on-premises, and on AWS. Also worked with Rust and Go when necessary.

\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented a service to manage IoT devices and their lifecycles, capable of sustaining a throughput of over 70k events per second, and integrating with the core logging product.
\item General feature development, including database and API design, building DSLs, and making service architecture decisions.
\item Involved in selection of tooling and strategies, including POCs and performance comparisons, to be used within the product. This includes successfully converting and spinning up new services on GraalVM.
\end{itemize}

{\sl Littlepay} \textbf{(Software Engineer)} \hfill August 2019 - September 2020

Worked mainly with Spring-based Java microservices on AWS (ECS), including managing infrastructure and deployments via Terraform. Other work included Scala in the analytics platform and various Node Lambdas.

\textbf{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Integrated with several acquiring banks, mainly using ISO8583, and PCI-compliant handling of cardholder data.
\item Took ownership of the analytics platform, including design, development, and deployments. This reuslted in significant stability improvements.
\item Lead process and tool improvement through POCs and implementation thereafter.
\item Uplifted, deprecated and replaced legacy systems thourghout the product streams.
\end{itemize}
