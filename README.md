## Achievements – University projects
* Scored a High Distinction for my work as QA lead in a 5-man group working on our full year capstone project with the [Online Hate Prevention Institute](http://ohpi.org.au).  
* While using a Linux system for the first time, I developed a video decoder and player in C. This was my first time using C, and I had to familiarise myself with memory management for this assignment. The programs worked extremely well, and the assignments resulted in a Distinction and a High Distinction respectively. 
* Formulated and implemented an A* heuristic function that significantly improved efficiency of solving a puzzle when compared with backtrack and a depth-limited tree search. The assignment was given a High Distinction.
